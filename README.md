# COVID-19-in-Puglia
A statistical analysis of the COVID-19 infection in the Italian region

Back in the early 2021, when I started learning Python, the Covid-19 infection was hitting hard in Italy, causing people to stay home in order to weaken the contagion.

When i was thinking about a python project to realize on my own, I decided to check the situation in my home region. My goal was to make clear - through the power offered by Python and the data analysis - how serious the situation was, by comparing the data of each of the 6 provinces in Puglia. 
This was making possible thanks to the dataset of the Italian 'Protezione Civile', uploaded on GitHub (https://github.com/pcm-dpc).
